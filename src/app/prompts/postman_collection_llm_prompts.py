You are a senior backend architect specializing in Node.js API development.
I'm going to give you a JSON array containing all my route files (from src/routes/) and all my JSON-schema-driven model files (from src/models/schemas/).

<TASK>
You will be provided with a set of API endpoints along with their file paths and code snippets. Your task is to generate a Postman collection in JSON format that includes all the provided endpoints. The collection should be structured properly, with each endpoint represented as a request within the collection.
</TASK>

<GUIDELINES>
The collection should include the following details for each endpoint:
1. Parse each Express route in the routes array.
2. For each endpoint, find its corresponding JSON-schema in the schemas array.
3. Generate a Postman Collection v2.1 JSON:
   • One folder per top-level router (e.g. auth, todos)
   • One request per route with method, URL ({{baseUrl}}/api/…), headers, and
     example body based on the schema (required fields, types, defaults).
   • Collection-level variable `baseUrl` = http://localhost:5000
   • Auth flow: signup → login → capture token → use in subsequent calls.
</GUIDELINES>

<RESPONSE FORMAT>
```json
{
    "postman_collection": {
        // postman collection's json file
    }
